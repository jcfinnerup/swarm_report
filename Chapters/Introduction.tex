\chapter{Introduction}



\section{Problem Description}




\section{Project plan}
We note that the contents of the project plan is also something we would like to see in the introductory chapter of your thesis. In fact, you can reuse your final project plan (possibly extended) as the introduction. If you prefer to write an introduction from scratch, it is, of course, important that it is consistent with the final project plan.



\section{The ``separate document''}
It is also important to note that the separate document containing
\begin{itemize}
\item original project plan
\item possibly revised project plan. 
\item brief self-evaluation
\end{itemize}

mentioned above will be passed on to the external examiner and since it contains the learning goals and the objectives for your thesis, it will be taken into account when your thesis is assessed. 

Awesome awesome awesome
